		<th text-align:left>Demi Bourbon
Demi Bourbon and her brother Sam came to a small European town at the age of 16. Sam opened a bar, the business was flat at first, until Sam concocted a drink called "Dovlin", which became a big hit in town. However, when Demi was curious and wanted to try "Dovlin", Sam refused her for various reasons. One day Sam told Demi that he was closing the bar because he had been offered a job as a bartender, believing that the new job would bring them more income and a more stable life, but Sam never returned. To make a living, Demi had to reopen the bar. But the business was bad. On her 20th birthday, she received a letter. Inside the envelope with the red lacquer seal was a strange recipe. With the mentality of giving it a try, she entertained the regular customers of the bar, and the regular customers told her that this was "Dovlin". She believed that the recipe must be related to her brother's disappearance, so she decided to go to Oletus Manor.

		   <th text-align:left>Patricia Dorval
Patricia Dorval was born on a slave ship where her mother drew her last breath. Little Patrica reached New Orleans alive, the shipowner left her on the street. She thus found a new “mother”. Patricia followed her “mother”, learning herbs, healing and cursing, and when she reached adulthood she decided to go back to her foreign homeland to look for her origin. Patricia never thought that the curse hidden in her blood would gradually emerge at the moment she stepped onto the land. After running away for a decade, she finally arrived at Oletus Manor with the curse.

		  <th text-align:left>Melly Plinius
Melly Plinius, the Entomologist, has always been a prominent figure in the biology field, partly due to her background. She started off as a poor manor servant before marrying the owner. After he died, she inherited her husband's wealth and became a rising star in the biology field. Such a humble success story never fails to gain attention, especially when she holds a unique perspective in the study of insects, the Pterygota in particular. She seems to possess the ability to maneuver the tiny insects, gaining a deeper understanding of their activities. There are even more rumors about her appearance, for she seldom makes an appearance in public. Her passion lies in the search for peculiar insects, spending her time roaming in dense forests, swamps, and wilderness, rather than attending those pretentious symposiums. In the few times that she did make a public appearance, she always wore an exaggerated gauze hat. Some say she's too ugly to show her face while others say she's so beautiful that she didn't want people to focus on her beauty instead of her research.

		  <th text-align:left>Emma Woods
Having found "the one," Emma can finally focus on perfecting her gardening skills. Maybe dear Mr. Scarecrow still needs some new duds. Replace the rotten straw, throw on a new hat. Of course, appearance isn't the only thing she cares about. But, hey, what's wrong with dressing up your dream lover? As long as you have the money.
