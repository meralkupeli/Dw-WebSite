		<th text-align:left>Martha Behamfil
Martha was good at riding and shooting when she was young and attained the rank of captain after joining the cavalry. Not content to just gallop on horseback, Martha learned basic piloting skills and fell in love with flying. She quit her position in the cavalry and joined the Air Force. However, instead of becoming a pilot, as she had wished, Martha was required to perform signal guide work on the ground. To fly her own plane, she has to find a reliable "sponsor".

		   <th text-align:left>Jose Baden
First officer Jose Baden, together with the captain's father, escorted the British king's maritime empire. However, one day he was delayed in Liverpool for some reason, and did not go to sea with his father. The ship carrying the antiques for the King of England did not return on time. Jose received news that an antique umbrella from China was on the cargo list of the missing ship, and it was now in a place called Oletus Manor. This former sea knight decides to step into this cursed land himself, to find his father, or at least... to take back what belongs to him.

		  <th text-align:left>Andrew Kreiss
For Andrew, gossip is more terrifying than illnesses. Such malice separates him and all that's good and warm in this world like an intangible wall. He used to look out of the window, longing to live under the sun like other youths, to be able to enjoy all the joy, love and hope in this world, instead of being called the "white-haired monster". 
Looking for salvation, Andrew came to the Laz Church Cemetery, known as the "Temple" by the world. He became a grave keeper in the company of cold epitaphs and the silent dead. It wasn't until he received the invitation from the Manor where the words in the letter moved him that he felt understood for the first time...

Naib was once a Gurkha mercenary who worked for an East Indian company. Like most Gurkhas, he is neither tall nor physically strong. But Gurkha warriors stand for discipline and bravery. As a retired mercenary, Naib Subedar is used to making a living by killing. Can a dangerous game offer him the same experience as the battlefield?

		  Murro
Muro grew up like a half savage in the forest. He was discovered by passers-by and returned to "civilization". He once learned how to be a gentleman. After experiencing betrayals and struggles Murro decided to give up trying to fit into so-called civilized society. Perhaps the Oletus Manor would be his ultimate destination?
