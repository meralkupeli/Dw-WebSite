		<th text-align:left>Aesop Carl
There are minor differences in the final destination of people's lives and Aesop Carl is most definitely the person people envision sending them on their final journey. He follows every procedural step rigorously and affords the highest respect to visitors that have come to their final destination. He decided to take the place of an unfortunate, mysterious mother and complete her final wish after finding that letter on her.

		   <th text-align:left>Victor Grantz
Victor is a peculiar boy. He's not good with words and is afraid of socializing. Victor prefers the company of little animals than hanging out with people.
While he comes across numerous letters every day, none of them is for him.
However, given his gallantry during a fire, people really trust Victor. And the puppy, Wick, whom he saved from the fire, has been accompanying him to deliver letters since then.
Victor loves seeing the look on people's faces when they receive their letter: touched, shocked, disappointed, delighted... He enjoys being the key to other people's secret communication. He strongly believes that face-to-face conversations are filled with pretense and lies to conceal people's feelings. The truly important secrets and thoughts are hidden between the lines and waiting for his delivery.
When the invitation from the Manor came, Victor finally received his first letter. He has no doubt about the sincere invitation in the letter and heads to the Manor with Wick excitedly.
