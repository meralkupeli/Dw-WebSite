		<th text-align:left>Kurt Frank
Kurt is an experienced explorer, passionate about exploring the limits of humanity. He has sailed across the English Channel, flown over old-growth forests in a hot air balloon, and, of course, joined a life-or-death game. As a master of survival, maybe he has a good shot at winning?

Since a botched lawsuit, Freddy has been toiling away at a menial job with a pathetic wage.

		  <th text-align:left>Tracy Reznik
Tracy is a mechanic. She had been wrapped up in her "useless" little inventions and obsessed with gunpowder experiments. These projects soon depleted her inheritance from her parents and put her deeply in debt. The invitation letter promised a golden prize, but what truly attracted Tracy were the secret gadgets in the manorâ€¦

		  <th text-align:left>Luca Balsa
Luca Balsa used to be considered friendly and too trusting by most people. No one knows where he came from or has seen his family, but clearly, he's well educated. He has a tremendous sense of pride and he is curious about all sorts of scientific inventions. 
And so it's no surprise that he became the assistant of the most famous inventor in town. 
The great inventor thinks highly of Luca and a lot of people thought he would be the inventor's successor. Yet everything came to a halt because of an academic dispute. 
The great inventor claimed that Luca sold his research to a competitor behind his back, that Luca is an ungrateful traitor. Yet Luca said the great inventor is a thief who has run out of ideas. 
No one knows what actually happened as the great inventor died in an accident in the laboratory, while Luca suffered irreversible brain damage and was accused of murder. 
Luca was sentenced to hang, but he was somehow pardoned at the last minute. 
Yet there is no turning back for Luca. His memory becomes poor and he can't concentrate on his work. He can no longer conduct scientific researche and all of his savings went to the immense compensation for the inventor's wife. 
Nevertheless, Luca is still determined to complete his initial invention, but this requires a lot of money. And so he decides to take a gamble on the invitation which promised him an enormous reward.

		  Helena Adams
Helena lost her vision in a fever when she was 1 year old, but she still learned how to read and write from her parents and a tutor. However, Helena has a greater ambition: getting a college degree. Can the owner of Oletus Manor pay for her tuition? That's what the braille invitation letter suggested, at least.
